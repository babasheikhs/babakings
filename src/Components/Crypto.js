    Cryptocurrency came from nowhere and took over the internet space. well not quite,
     Bitcoin was the game changer though and now we have quite loads of them.
     The aspect we are dealing with here is by making some cash while doing little.
     </p>
<p>
     I have tried investing in crypto in the past but have never been able to make any profit.
      I later mostly only invest in the stable ones and then take advantage of the various
       finance methods of earning from crypto. So, instead of putting my spare money in the
       bank I save it on crypto. But really I don’t do any of that anymore. Since, I discovered
       some ways of earning from this crypto platform easily without losing any money. Even if
        it's as little as £20 every now and then. So I will be sharing those few tips and which platform.

<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a></strong> is the number one here.
 Here you just need to sign up and verify your
 identity. Then you can learn about new crypto products and earn. Just go to the menu and you will
 see learn with the amount also shown. So after those short learnings then a quiz is given.
 After that you get paid. Over a few weeks I have earned up to £50 bucks there. Those quizzes are
  really easy and if you choose the wrong answer then choose another until you get it right. It’s
   that easy. Also if you are a new user they also have some promotions that pay. Every now and then
    though just check back for any new crypto to learn about and earn.

<p>
<strong><a href="https://crypto.com/">Crypto.com</a></strong> These ones give some dollars when
you sign up with them. The condition
is to buy some crypto currency on the platform. What I did then or what I normally do for others like
that is to buy the crypto amount then quickly convert it to a stable coin like USDT or others like that.
</p>

Others: I have used many crypto platforms in the past. Just try and search around for a couple of
 them. I have earned about $200 one time like that for just signing up and buying crypto. Because
 of the high volatility, I try to buy stable coins or convert them to stable coins as quickly as
  possible. I normally just had to sacrifice like maybe £5 for transaction fee but most times
  much less. So, try to do your research and make sure whatever fee you will incur will be much
   less than the promo they are given.
