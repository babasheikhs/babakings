This is my favourite part. I play games normally on the phone when I need to kill time,
 relax or just to catch fun. Until I saw that I can play games and earn some bucks at the
  same time. It is not much but it’s something.

<strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mistplay.mistplay&gl=US">Mistplay</a></strong> still remains my favorite. They pay you for playing games. I don’t think they have
 paypal but they have got amazon gift cards and many more. I mostly play these games to earn
  amazon gift cards when I need to buy some books on Amazon. Just saying, you can use your
   gift card to buy anything you want. So, how it works is that you download mistplay on your
    phone. So from inside the mistplay app you download the games and play. Mistplay tracks
    your progress and increases your coin. It is the coin at the top right corner, when it
     gets to 200 then you get £5. Believe me it gets there quickly in a day even before you know it.

<strong><a href="swagbucks.com">Swagbucks</a></strong> used to pay alot for playing easy games but now not very much. They have got lots of
 games that still pay quite well. If you are a gamer then don’t pay for free anymore. Just head
  down to swagbucks, play and earn.

<strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.current.android&gl=US">Mode-earn-app</a></strong> This app pays for playing games as well just like the others. I got my airpod
from them as a reward for playing games. I still use the airpod till today. Mode-earn-app really
has much more to offer than just playing games. They also pay to listen to music. If you are also
 a music lover then earn while doing it.

<strong>Others</strong> there are other ones I have used too but not as much till now. They ll work the same way
as mistplay but not as easy reaching the payout as mistplay though. I have used them before and
earned as well. Apps like playKarma, appKarma and Appstation all are good ones to earn for playing
games. Most of these ones are good the first time but not so good after the first earning.
