    <p>
I am a Chartered Accountant and web developer. I am generally tech savvy.
IT generally has always been fun for me, more of an hubby that takes its own life form.
 Then I realized web development and it was even
more fun. So, I began learning so much about it and many more like how SEO works,
 digital marketing, cloud computing, data analytics and just anything IT.
 I created this website using React.

 I think it
occur to me to share some of the little things I do during my spare time to earn just a
 little though which could go a long way in paying some little bills. I share mainly the
 things I have tried and exactly as it was when I used them.
