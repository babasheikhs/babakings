    Surveys have been around for longtime. We have probably all heard about it. But the aspect
    of survey we are interested in talking about here is the ones that really pays.
    </p>
    <p>
    I came about surveys last year ending. My partner used to do it sparingly but
     I never gave it any thought. Until I was temporarily short of cash that week
      but this little bill like energy bills and broadband never stopped. So I asked
       my partner how do you normally do this survey thing? She showed me and it was
        really easy. But the one she showed me still takes time like a week or less to
         pay but I needed it the same day. So, I began my search and found a couple that
          pay instantly after earning. These are the ones I have used before and still use.

<strong><a href="https://www.lifepointspanel.com/en-gb/registration">Life Points</a></strong> I use this one very well. The survey environment is friendly and
easy to use. They always have lots of surveys to answer. Just answer them honestly as they are
 mostly day to day things we normally do. They pay through paypal and other gift cards. It normally
  takes about a week though.

<strong><a href="https://pollpay.app/">Poll pay</a></strong> These ones can pay to paypal instantly. The day I mentioned that I
 needed a little instant cash, this was the one I used. I don’t really use them much because of
  some longer surveys. I mean longer to answer than the pay. But sometimes they give moderately
  short surveys with good pay.

<strong><a href="https://www.ylive-community.com/register">Ylive</a></strong> These ones have changed their name several times. If only they paid quickly
and regularly for surveys, they would have been my number one. Their surveys are paid almost by
or more than minimum wages. Their surveys are easy to answer, not long and good pay. They only pay
 when you have earned 50 credit which is equivalent to £50 pounds and in the beginning of the
 following month. So let’s say you earn 50 credits this month then in the first week of the
 following month you will be paid. For me it's easy 50 bucks every month.

<strong><a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/">Swagbucks</a></strong> They have got cool stuff and much more than just surveys. I really
don’t like their surveys though because it cuts off too often. But watch out for the very high
 paying ones like 10 mins for £5 kind of surveys. Those ones are rarely cut off and are very easy
  to answer although it might require. Other stuff you can find here is cashback on all your purchases.
   So before making any online purchase check if swagbucks have got cashback for  them then buy it
    through them. Just type the site in their search box and visit the merchant link from there.
